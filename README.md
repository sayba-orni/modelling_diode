Project Title:
Simulating 4 diode models (exponential, piece-wise linear, constant voltage drop, ideal model)
using MATLAB.
Objective:
1. Netlist of the circuit will be taken as input through a GUI.
2. User can choose any of the 4 diode models.
3. The output will show which diodes are in forward bias and which are in reverse.
4. The output will also show the diode voltage and diode current according to the
chosen model.
5. Input can be AC/DC.
6. Should be able to show plot of any node voltage or branch current.
